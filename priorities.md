# Priorities

Worked top to bottom under the autonomy policy in CLAUDE.md. Future
sessions: pick up at the first item not marked done.

## 1. [DONE 2026-06-11] Item effect schema: passives, Eternals, augments into the math

Done when: a typed, curated effect schema (`engine/fixtures/effects.json`)
encodes the mathematically tractable item passives, the 12 Eternal majors
plus unambiguous minors, and at least one hero's augments; the simulator
consumes them (on-hit procs, ability amps, cooldown modifiers); coverage is
reported, uncodable effects are listed as unmodeled rather than guessed;
harness green with new effect tests; design doc + lessons.md updated;
committed.

## 2. [DONE 2026-06-11] Match-feed aggregates: real gold curves and play rates

Done when: an ingest script aggregates a recent window of pvp+ranked
matches (timestamp-driven, polite rates) into a committed snapshot with
per-role gold-by-minute percentiles and per-hero item play rates (via the
game_id map); the placeholder gold values in calibration.json are replaced
by measured ones (levels stay provisional, they are not in the feed);
play rates are surfaced in the CLI for the off-meta gate; harness green
with aggregate sanity tests; design doc + lessons.md updated; committed.

## 3. CALIBRATION GATE — checklist delivered 2026-06-11 (engine/fixtures/CALIBRATION-CHECKLIST.md); maintainer deferred measurements same day

Open until the maintainer measures. Per autonomy rule 2 the constants
stay unverified, every dependent output stays THEORY, and work continues
on items that do not require them. Re-check this gate each session.

## 4. [DONE 2026-06-11] Matchup checkpoint engine (includes purchase-order optimization)

Done when: builds get a gold-curve-aware purchase order with a measured
spike timeline (item completion minutes from the aggregate gold curves);
matchups are evaluated at the calibration checkpoints with both sides'
real base stats + build prefixes (kill-window ratios, per-phase verdicts
with drivers); levels-provisional and THEORY flags propagate to output;
CLI --vs <enemy>; harness green; design doc + lessons.md updated;
committed.

## 5. [DONE 2026-06-11] Statistical evidence layer v0

Done when: the aggregator records per-hero per-item win counts; shrunk
item-on-hero winrate deltas (empirical Bayes toward the hero-role mean)
are computable and surfaced as evidence (never a generator input); CLI
shows evidence next to play rates; harness green; docs updated; committed.

## 6. Artifact pipeline + Zone 1 hero-page prototype (Concept A, section 8)

Done when: a build step emits per-hero JSON artifacts (builds, eternals,
matchup checkpoints, off-meta proofs, confidence flags) and a static
prototype page renders The Answer zone from them.

## 7. LLM copy pass with ground-check verifier.
