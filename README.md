## Why This Exists

Every stat site tells you WHAT to build and WHO to pick but never WHY.

I came into Predecessor after my Paragon buddies put me on. 400+ hours later, still Gold 1, and the learning curve is steep. Most tools throw stats at you without explaining anything. Console players can't alt-tab during draft. pred.gg's counter page has been broken.

This supplements existing tools by going deeper into the WHY behind counters, builds, matchups, and team comp.

## What We're Building

- **Counter reasoning**: not just "pick X into Y" but why it works and what to do in the matchup
- **Build education**: a lab where you can slot items and learn what works together (and what doesn't)
- **Augment context**: how augments shift a hero's playstyle and what that means for you or against you
- **Draft helper**: team analysis and suggestions as you fill slots
- **Mobile first**: built for your phone during draft, not a responsive afterthought
- **Tap to learn**: tags, items, augments, crests. tap anything for explanation and tips

## The Approach

Everything is statistically derived from real match data, then layered with hand-curated context:

- 49 hero kits analyzed with trait profiles (heal/shield subtypes, combat patterns, archetypes)
- 147 augments manually classified with playstyle and counter tips
- 188 items and 48 crests tagged with buy tips, counter tips, and synergy info
- Counter picks ranked by head-to-head win rate (20-match minimum)
- No black box ML. Transparent scoring you can verify

## Work in Progress

This is actively being built. Data, tips, and features are improving every day. Some things to know:

- All-ranks data (rank filtering is on the roadmap)
- Tags and classifications are hand-curated by one person. Some edge cases are debatable
- Sample sizes vary on niche role picks
- Augment interactions are complex and not all fully captured yet
